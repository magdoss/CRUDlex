Introduction
============

CRUDlex is an easy to use CRUD generator for `Silex <http://silex.sensiolabs.org/>`_.
CRUD is an abbreviation standing for

* **C** reate
* **R** ead
* **U** pdate
* **D** elete

Often, you have a database where you are in need of an administration
application.
You have some database tables you need to manage with exactly this actions:

* A list of entries in each table
* To be able to create entries
* View each entry on it's own with all details
* Edit the entry
* Delete the entry

It is tedious to write this on your own. Not hard, but always the same with
only the table names, field names, field types etc. varying.

This is where CRUDlex comes in. Whenever you need a quick administration panel
for your Silex application, it might be a good starting point. It is easy to use
with minimal configuration but still offers a lot of features and flexibility.

In the next chapter, a most basic setup is described.
