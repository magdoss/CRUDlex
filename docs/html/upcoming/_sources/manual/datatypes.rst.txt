Data Types
==========

This is a comprehensive list of all supported data types, their parameters and
the related MySQL-types.

----
Text
----

.. code-block:: yaml

    type: text

A single text line, no further parameters. Related MySQL-types:

* CHAR
* VARCHAR (recommended)
* TINYTEXT
* TEXT
* MEDIUMTEXT
* LONGTEXT

---------
Multiline
---------

.. code-block:: yaml

    type: multiline

A multi text line allowing linebreaks, no further parameters. Related MySQL-types:

* CHAR
* VARCHAR
* TINYTEXT
* TEXT (recommended)
* MEDIUMTEXT
* LONGTEXT

If the field is shown in the list view and the value is longer than 27
characters, the rest is cut and replaced with three dots. The full text is still
available as tooltip in the list view though. Example with 50 characters:

"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing"

Would be shown in the list view as:

"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,..."

-------
WYSIWYM
-------

.. code-block:: yaml

    type: multiline

A visual WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean) editor producing HTML. Related
MySQL-types:

* CHAR
* VARCHAR
* TINYTEXT
* TEXT (recommended)
* MEDIUMTEXT
* LONGTEXT

Pay attention that the database type can store all content. Else, the HTML might be just cut and broken.

---
Url
---

.. code-block:: yaml

    type: url

A single text line representing an URL, no further parameters. Related
MySQL-types:

* CHAR
* VARCHAR (recommended)
* TINYTEXT
* TEXT
* MEDIUMTEXT
* LONGTEXT

The only difference to the type "text" is that url fields are clickable in the
list and show view. They are shortened in the list view to their base name in
order to save space. A value of::

    http://www.foo.com/bar.txt

would lead to::

    http://www.foo.com/bar.txt

on click and is shortened to "bar.txt" in the list.

-------
Integer
-------

.. code-block:: yaml

    type: integer

An integer, no further parameters. Related MySQL-types:

* TINYINT
* SMALLINT
* MEDIUMINT
* INT (recommended)
* BIGINT

-----
Float
-----

.. code-block:: yaml

    type: float
    floatStep: 0.1

An float. Related MySQL-types:

* FLOAT (recommended)
* DECIMAL
* DOUBLE (recommended)
* REAL

The parameter "floatStep" is to set the step size in the form field.

-------
Boolean
-------

.. code-block:: yaml

    type: boolean

A boolean value, either true or false, no further parameters. Related MySQL-type:

* TINYINT

Saved as 0 (false) or 1 (true).

----
Date
----

.. code-block:: yaml

    type: date

A date value without time, no further parameters. Related MySQL-types:

* DATE
* DATETIME (recommended)
* TIMESTAMP

--------
Datetime
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

    type: datetime

A date value with time, no further parameters. Related MySQL-type:

* DATETIME (recommended)
* TIMESTAMP

---
Set
---

.. code-block:: yaml

    type: set
    items: [red, green, blue]

A fixed set of elements to be chosen from, stored as text. Related MySQL-types:

* CHAR
* VARCHAR (recommended)
* TINYTEXT
* TEXT
* MEDIUMTEXT
* LONGTEXT

In this example, the user has the choice between the three colors "red", "green"
and "blue".

---------
Reference
---------

.. code-block:: yaml

    type: reference
    reference:
      nameField: otherName
      entity: otherEntity
      hideId: false

This is the 1-side of a one-to-many relation. Related MySQL-type:

* INT

In order to display a proper selection UI and represent the the value from the
other table, a few more fields are needed. Those are the *nameField* describing
which field to use from the other table to display the selected value and last,
the referenced *entity*.

The *nameField* is optional. If it is not given, only the id of the referenced
*entity* is shown.

The optional parameter *hideId* allows to display the reference without its id, if set to *true*.

Think about a book in a library. The library is stored in the table "library" and
has a field "name". A book belongs to a library, so it has an integer field
"library" referencing ids of libraries. Here is the needed yml for this
book-library relationship:

.. code-block:: yaml

    library:
        table: lib
        label: Library
        fields:
            name:
                type: text
    book:
        table: book
        label: Book
        fields:
            title:
                type: text
            author:
                type: text
            library:
                type: reference
                reference:
                  nameField: name
                  entity: library

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Show Children
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to show the children (books in this case) on the details page of the
parent (library), you can activate it via the childrenLabelFields:

.. code-block:: yaml

    library:
        table: lib
        label: Library
        childrenLabelFields:
            book: title
        fields:
            name:
                type: text
    book:
        table: book
        label: Book
        fields:
            title:
                type: text
            author:
                type: text
            library:
                type: reference
                reference:
                  nameField: name
                  entity: library

On a details page of a library, all of its books are now displayed by their
title field. If a library had more children and their label fields are not
defined, it falls back to the id field.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Cascading Children Deletion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default setup is, that referenced entities can't be deleted until their
children are deleted. In this case, a library can't be deleted until all of its
books are gone. You can force children deletion by using the *deleteCascade*
setting like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    library:
        table: lib
        label: Library
        childrenLabelFields:
            book: title
        deleteCascade: true
        fields:
            name:
                type: text
    book:
        table: book
        label: Book
        fields:
            title:
                type: text
            author:
                type: text
            library:
                type: reference
                reference:
                  nameField: name
                  entity: library

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MySQL Foreign Key Hint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Don't forget to set the MySQL foreign key.

.. code-block:: sql

    ALTER TABLE `book`
    ADD CONSTRAINT `book_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`library`) REFERENCES `lib` (`id`);

----
Many
----

.. code-block:: yaml

    libraryBook:
        type: many
        many:
            entity: book
            nameField: title
            thisField: library
            thatField: book
            hideId: false

A many-to-many relation. For MySQL, the field key is the name of the cross table.
So the sample above translates to this structure:

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE TABLE `libraryBook` (
      `library` int(11) NOT NULL,
      `book` int(11) NOT NULL,
      KEY `library` (`library`),
      KEY `book` (`book`),
      CONSTRAINT `librarybook_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`library`) REFERENCES `library` (`id`),
      CONSTRAINT `librarybook_ibfk_2` FOREIGN KEY (`book`) REFERENCES `book` (`id`)
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

The fields of the many key have the following meaning:

* **entity**: the other entity
* **nameField**: the representing field on the other entity for button labels,
  selection etc.; this key is optional, if it is not given, only the id will
  be shown
* **thisField**: the field of the cross table referencing the entity with the
  many field
* **thatField**: the field of the cross table referencing the other entity
  named with the entity field of the many key
* **hideId** (optional) allows to display the reference without its id, if set to *true*.

Think about a library having many books and a book being in many libraries.
The library is stored in the table "library" and has a field "name". Here is
the needed yml for this book-library many-to-many relationship:

.. code-block:: yaml

    library:
        table: lib
        label: Library
        fields:
            name:
                type: text
            libraryBook:
                type: many
                many:
                    entity: book
                    nameField: title
                    thisField: library
                    thatField: book
    book:
        table: book
        label: Book
        fields:
            title:
                type: text
            author:
                type: text

Attention: In the list view, it is not possible to sort by many fields as it
doesn't make that much sense.

----
File
----

CRUDlex supports the handling of files. They get uploaded with the create or
edit form, can be viewed, removed and replaced.

To have an image field for our library, you would declare it like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    library:
        table: lib
        label: Library
        fields:
            image:
                type: file
                path: uploads

The images are stored in the filesystem relative to your index.php within the
subfolder you give with the path parameter.

If you edit an entity with a file and re-upload it or if you delete the file or
if you delete the entity, the current implementation is defensive and doesn't
physically delete the files.

See the :doc:`filehandling` chapter for more details.
