Routes
======

There are a bunch of routes used by CRUDlex which are useful to know if one wants to link to them or add middleware.

This are the name of the routes added by the ControllerProvider.

Adding Silex 2 Middleware
-------------------------


Here is an example of how to add a middleware after mounting the ControllerProvider:

.. code-block:: php

    $app->flush();
    $route = $app['routes']->get('crudList');
    $route->before(function(Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request $request) use ($app) {
        // Do your stuff.
    });
